## What We're Doing

1. Lifted is building a framework of common Web2 and Web3 functionality that can be
   assembled into a custom layer 1 network. Check it out
   [here](https://github.com/the-lifted-initiative/many-framework).
2. Lifted is coordinating a network where folks can build their ideas without prior
   blockchain experience. Check it out [here](https://theliftedinitiative.org).
3. Lifted is contributing to the Many Protocol, which enables full interoperability
   between Many modules and any network built with them. Check it out
   [here](https://github.com/many-protocol).
