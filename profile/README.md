# The Lifted Initiative

## Who We Are

The Lifted Initiative is on a mission to make Web3 more accessible and sustainable. 
Learn more at our [website](https://liftedinit.org).

## What We're Doing

1. Lifted is building a
   [framework](https://github.com/liftedinit/many-framework) of Web2 and Web3
   features for you to assemble a custom layer 1 network.
2. Lifted is launching a network so you can build your ideas without blockchain
   experience.
3. Lifted is contributing to the [Many Protocol](https://github.com/many-protocol),
   enabling interoperability between Many modules and any network built with them.

## How You Can Help

- You can contribute on GitHub. Whether you're spotting typos or refactoring algorithms,
  every bit helps. Most of our repositories have READMEs and our 
  [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/liftedinit/.github/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) can help you get up and running up 
  and running quickly.
- You can join the conversation. We're slowly expanding our social media presence and
  trying to get people talking about important topics like barriers to entry and improving
  environmental impact. We want your voice!
- You can tell your friends. Know someone who would be interested in what we're doing?
  Send them our way â€” the more people involved the better.
