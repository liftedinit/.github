# Introduction

Thank you for taking the time to read this document and for your interest in making
decentralized technology more accessible and sustainable. It's an important task and your
contribution is truly valued.

Any time people work together, but especially when they care deeply about what they're
doing, the possibility of disagreement or even conflict arises. The following guidelines
are intended to lubricate all that human interaction and make organizing, prioritizing,
developing, and releasing changes not only fast and painless but hopefully fun.

There are lots of ways to contribute, from fixing typos in documentation to submitting bug
reports and feature requests, to writing and reviewing code. They're all welcome and we
hope you have a look around to find something that's both valuable to the project and
personally enjoyable to you.

However, discussions should remain relevant to the issues and code at hand. GitHub is not
a place to debate the future of Web3 in general or the relative merits of different
projects in the industry. Other forums such as Discord, Reddit, and Twitter are much mroe
suitable.

# Expectations

The Lifted Initiative has adopted a [Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/liftedinit/.github/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
for all behavior related to the projects within the organization. Please read it before
you start interacting with the community.

We are a small team but try our best to respond to all questions and comments. If you've
pinged us in a comment and we haven't responded, chances are we haven't gotten to it yet.

In general, issues should be used to report bugs and request features and pull requests
should be opened for the implementation of those fixes and features. That way the
discussion in issues can focus on the details of the problem and discussion in the pull
requests can focus on the details of the solution.

Be sure to follow the additional guidance in our issue templates.

# Getting Started

## Where to Start

Not sure where to start? You can review open issues in each of the projects and filter by
the "help wanted" or "good first issue" labels. That means someone has decided that issues
is a good place for you to get your feet wet and that contributions are welcome. So you
can expect a little more guidance from existing contributors.

If you're new to Open Source (and we all were once), then take a little time to learn [how
pull requests work](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) before getting too deep.

## Forking

All projects use a fork-and-pull model for development, meaning your development workflow
is going to look like:

1. Fork the repository to your own personal account
2. Make any changes in your own fork
3. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the upstream repository

Be sure to follow the additional guidance in our pull request template.

## Running Locally

Every project will have its own details on how to set up your local environment to run
tests and compile or run the code on your machine. The project README file will be an
important resource for you.

# Submitting Issues

**IMPORTANT: If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Please email
community@liftedinit.org instead.**

What's a security vulnerability? If you can access something supposed to be secret, edit
or delete something that doesn't belong to you, change a feature's behavior in a malicious
way, or anything else that just seems fishy: consider it a security vulnerability.

## Bug Reports

When you open a new issue and select the Bug Report template, your issue will be
pre-populated with questions like:

- What is the bug?
- How can someone reproduce it?
- What is the expected behavior?
- What operating system and browser are you using? (if relevant)
- Any screenshots?

Answering these questions as thoroughly as possible will help others reproduce and
hopefully fix your bug.

## Feature Requests

When you open a new issue and select the Feature Request template, your issue will be
pre-populated with questions like:

- Is your feature related to a problem?
- What solution would you like to see?
- What alternatives have you considered?
- Any additional context, like screenshots?

Again, filling out the template as much as possible will aid our community in
understanding, prioritizing, and eventually implementing your request.

For changes _larger_ than simple features, such as new modules or integrations, we will
likely add your issue to a public roadmap so everyone can track its progress. But remember
that not every suggestion is accepted and sometimes, even if you volunteer to do the work,
a feature request might be closed because it's not compatible with the vision that
maintainers have for a particular project.

# Code Review

The Lifted Initiative core engineers review new issues and pull requests on a weekly basis
and are reviewing activity on existing issues and pull requests throughout the week. To
get your contribution accepted, we'll review your pull request and possibly make some
comments. Some comments will be hard requirements to be considered ready to merge, while
others might be suggestions. Please ask questions if the comments don't make sense to you.

It can be intimidating to have your pull request marked "Request changes" from a code
review, but it means that the reviewer believes your changes are worth the time to get
right.

We expect changes requested to a pull request to be made in a timely fashion. If a pull
request hasn't had any activity (new changes or comments) for a while, we may choose to
close it to remain focused on active pull requests.

# Community

GitHub isn't the only place you can connect with others about these projects and others
like them. You can reach The Lifted Initiative in the following channels:
